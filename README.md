# Battleship-project-from-Edx-course-Object-Oriented-Programming-in-Java-by-Microsoft-
All of us must have played the game Battleship in our childhood. Destroying our opponents ships and conquering victory on the shores. I have tried to implement the game on my Java project. The user plays the game vs the computer. I have tried to include all the concepts which I have learned till now. I request you too please look to my code and code suggestions are most welcomed. Thank you.
